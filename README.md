## 30 Days of Python

Since everyone has been trying coding challenges (100 Days of Code) I decided to run along with 30 Days of Python code to better my understanding of the language.

In this repo I will go through topics each day not consistent but trying to cover all the challenges with [Asabeneh](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python) 30 Days of Python Challenges.
I hope by the end of this I will be able to code and solve basic and complex problems in Python.

### TOPICS

- [Day 2](./Day_2)
- [Day 3](./Day_3)

- [Day 14 - 26](./Day_14-26)
- [Day 27](./Day_27)
- [Day 28 - 29](./Day_28-29)

The last day was a project about a terminal based code about booking system in hotel, has basic concepts easier to understand and follow. 
The project name is Doolitlle I have a repo specific for it.

### Special Thanks
I would like to thank Corey Schafer for his tutorials on some of the concepts and Asabeneh for providing guide and exercises on what to do each and every day of my study in Python.
