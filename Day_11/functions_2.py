# 6. Write a function called calculate_slope which return the slope of a linear equation
# 7. Quadratic equation is calculated as follows: axÂ² + bx + c = 0. Write a function which calculates solution set of a quadratic equation, _solve_quadratic_eqn_.
# 8. Declare a function named print_list. It takes a list as a parameter and it prints out each element of the list.
# 9. Declare a function named reverse_list. It takes an array as a parameter and it returns the reverse of the array (use loops).

# ```py
# print(reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
# # [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
# print(reverse_list1(["A", "B", "C"]))
# # ["C", "B", "A"]
# ```
